"""Allowed ROS header frame_ids (used by :term:`tf2`)

The ``camera_pinhole`` and ``world`` frames are coordinate systems in the cv2
pinhole camera model. The ``camera`` frame follows the convention where the x
axis points to the right from the body of the camera and z-axis forward along
the optical axis, it is not the ``camera_optical`` frame where the x axis
points in the direction of the optical axis.

The ``base_link`` frame is defined as the vehicle body :term:`FRD` frame.

The ``reference`` frame is the :term:`reference` arrays coordinate frame
where the origin is the bottom left (ROS convention, not numpy/cv2 top left
convention). x axis is the width axis, y axis is height. The static
``reference_{}_{}`` frame (in relation to :term:`WGS 84` coordinates)
is intended to be suffixed with the :term:`ROS` second and nanosecond
integer timestamps to allow the tf2 transformation chain to be matched
to the exact same reference frame that was used to for deriving the
:term:`orthoimage`. This is needed because the reference frame is
discontinuous (jumps around) and tf2 default interpolation cannot therefore
be applied to it.
