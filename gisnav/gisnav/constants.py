"""Allowed ROS header frame_ids.

:term:`REP 103` and :term:`REP 105` defined frames:

* ``camera``
* ``camera_optical``
* ``map``
* ``base_link``
* ``odom`` and ``earth`` not used currently, but could be introduced in the future.

:term:`OpenCV` ``cv2.solvePnP`` defined frames (not REP 103 compliant).

* ``query_image``
* ``query_world``
* ``reference_world``

The ``query_image`` frame is the image plane defined by the :term:`query image` 
where the origin is at the top left corner of the image and the "height" or Y-axis is 
therefore pointing down. 

The ``reference_image`` frame is the image plane defined by the 
:term:`bounding boxes <bounding box>`, where the origin is at the top left corner
of the image and the "height" or Y-axis is therefore pointing down. 

Introduced by GISNav (**currently** not REP 103 compliant):

* ``reference``
* ``reference_%i_%i``

The ``reference`` frame is the REP 103 compliant version of ``reference_world`` where
the origin is in the bottom-left corner instead of top-left, making it an :term:`ENU` 
frame.

``reference_%i_%i`` frame is a timestamped version of the ``reference`` frame 
where the first integer is the seconds timestamp and the second integer is the 
nanoseconds timestamp of the originating sensor_msgs/Image message containing
 the orthoimage :term:`raster` from :term:`GISNode`. Timestamping is needed
 because the ``reference`` frame is discontinuous, breaking `tf2` interpolation and
 necessitating using timestamps to match poses to correct frames instead.
 
 .. todo::
    Scale ``reference`` and ``reference_%i_%i`` to SI units (meters) instead of 
    the native pixels to be fully compliant with REP 103
