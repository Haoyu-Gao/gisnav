# Introduction

> **Warning** Do not use this software for real drone flights. GISNav is untested and has only been demonstrated
> in a simulation environment.

GISNav is a ROS 2 package that enables map-based visual navigation for airborne drones **in a simulation environment**.

GISNav provides a *precise* global position by visually comparing frames from the drone's nadir-facing camera to a map 
of the drone's *approximate* global position retrieved from an onboard GIS system.

# Mock GPS Example

The below steps demonstrate how GISNav enables GNSS-free flight with PX4 Autopilot's [Mission mode][1] in a SITL 
simulation.

You will need to have the [docker compose plugin][2] and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit][3] installed.

[2]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/
[3]: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html

## Build and run SITL simulation

Build the Docker images (may take a long time):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmakelin/gisnav.git
cd gisnav
make -C docker build-demo-px4
```

Run GISNav along with supporting services:
```bash
make -C docker demo
```

> **Note**
> If the Gazebo and QGroundControl windows do not appear on your screen you may need to expose your ``xhost`` to your 
> Docker containers (see e.g. [ROS GUI Tutorial][4]):
> ```bash
> for containerId in $(docker ps -f name=docker -q); do
>   xhost +local:$(docker inspect --format='{{ .Config.Hostname }}' $containerId)
> done
> ```
> See the [Docker troubleshooting section](https://www.gisnav.org/pages/developer_guide/sitl/docker.html#troubleshooting)
> in the developer documentation for more information.

## Upload flight plan via QGroundControl

Once both the Gazebo and QGroundControl windows have appeared (QGroundControl should show the drone location near San 
Carlos airport), use QGroundControl to upload the sample `~/ksql_airport_px4.plan` flight plan that is included inside the 
Docker container, and then start the mission.

## Simulate GPS failure

Wait until the drone has risen to its final mission altitude. You should see a visualization of the GISNav-estimated 
field of view projected on the ground appear. You can then try disabling GPS through your [MAVLink Shell][5] 
*(accessible e.g. through QGroundControl > Analyze Tools > MAVLink Console)*:

```
failure gps off
```

The drone should now continue to complete its mission *GNSS-free* with GISNav substituting for GPS.

You can check if PX4 is receiving the mock GPS position estimates by typing the following in the MAVLink shell:

```
listener sensor_gps
```

If the printed GPS message has a `satellites_used` field value of `255`, your PX4 is receiving the mock GPS node output 
as expected. QGroundControl will most likely show 0 satellites used next to the GPS icon as shown in the demo video.
