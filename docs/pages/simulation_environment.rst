Simulation Environment
===================================================
To use and develop with GISNav, you must setup your simulation environment, which includes setting up ROS 2, PX4 and
the PX4-ROS bridge, and Gazebo. The quickest way is to use the pre-made `Docker`_ script. However, here you will also
find instruction and links to guides to setup everything locally.


PX4 Autopilot and ROS 2 & Gazebo
___________________________________________________

You will need to setup the PX4 Autopilot with `ROS 2 and Gazebo <https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/ros_interface.html>`.



.. _Docker:

Option 1  *(recommended)*: Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A complete dockerized simulation environment is provided in the TODO repository. Follow the `Read Me`_ instructions to
get started with the dockerized environment. Clone and build the docker repo:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Clone the dockerized simulation environment

    cd $HOME && \
        git clone https://gitlab.com/px4-ros2-map-nav/px4-ros2-map-nav-sim.git

You will then need to build the environment by passing it the ``MAPPROXY_TILE_URL`` and ``NVIDIA_DRIVER_MAJOR_VERSION``
arguments. See the `WMS Endpoint`_ section for instruction on how to get an URL for the ``MAPPROXY_TILE_URL`` argument
if you do not have one yet. The example command uses ``nvidia-smi`` to find the major version installed on your system.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Build it

    cd px4-ros2-map-nav-sim && \
        docker-compose build \
            --build-arg MAPPROXY_TILE_URL="https://example.server.com/tiles/%(z)s/%(y)s/%(x)s" \
            --build-arg NVIDIA_DRIVER_MAJOR_VERSION=$(nvidia-smi | grep -oP 'Driver Version: \K[\d{3}]+') \
            .

Once you have your docker container you can run and terminate your
simulation environment by doing:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Run Gazebo example simulation with typhoon_h480 build target and ksql_airport.world

    docker-compose up -d

.. note::
    You should see the Gazebo and QGroundControl windows pop up soon on your screen. If you do not see them, you may
    need configure your ``xhost``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        xhost TODO

Finally, once you are done with your simulation, you can terminate it from your Terminal window:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Terminate example simulation

    docker-compose down


Option 2: Build It Yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _QGroundControl:

QGroundControl
**************************************************
`Download and install QGroundControl <https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/quick_start.html>`_ to
get your ground control software up and running. You will need it to control your drone in the Gazebo simulation.


PX4 Autopilot
**************************************************
You can setup your own PX4-Autopilot by following these instructions.

Open a new terminal window and type in the following command:
.. code-block:: bash

    make px4_sitl_rtps gazebo_typhoon_h480__ksql_airport


PX4-ROS 2 microRTPS bridge
**************************************************
You will need to setup the bridge with the following topic configuration:


gscam2
**************************************************

.. _`WMS endpoint`:

WMS Endpoint
___________________________________________________
The :class:`.BaseNode` class relies on a WMS to get map rasters for the estimated location of the vehicle, which will
then be used as input for the pose estimation. The WMS client :class:`.WMSClient` uses OWSLib and runs in a dedicated
thread, although it can also be configured to run in a dedicated process.

The example configuration uses mapproxy, which is lightweight and can be configured to both cache tiles and proxy a tile
based endpoint, which are common since they are more efficient, into a WMS endpoint. WMS endpiont is needed since the
GetMap request allows specifying a specific bounding box instead of a premade tile.

If your solution is Internet-connected, you can use any WMS endpoint. Otherwise you may choose to run your own mapproxy,
GeoServer or similar server onboard.

Own GIS Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The benefit of running your own GIS server is that you can embed it onboard the drone and not rely on an internet
connection. Accessing map tiles or rasters over the internet may be fine for simulation but most likely not for
real-world use.

If you want to run your own server or WMS proxy, you may want to consider e.g. these options:

    * `MapProxy <https://mapproxy.org/>`_ (used by the GISNav `Docker`_ example, proxy only but can cache tiles locally)
    * `GeoServer <https://geoserver.org/>`_ (full-fledged `OGC-compliant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium>`_ GIS server)

If you do not want to use commercial high-resolution data, you can load your own server with data from public domain
sources such as:

    * US:

        * `Farm Service Agency Aerial Photography Imagery Products and Programs <https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/farm-service-agency-aerial-photography-imagery-products-and-programs>`_

You may want to learn `GDAL <https://gdal.org/>`_ to process your downloaded geospatial products to a format that is
understood by your chosen GIS server.
