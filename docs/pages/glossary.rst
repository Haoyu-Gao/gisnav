    do not rely on these just yet. They may also not perfectly correspond to
    what is currently written in the source code.

Terminology
____________________________________________________

Here we provide explanations for terms used throughout this documentation that are
more esoteric or represent jargon i.e. have meanings unique to the context of this
documentation, deviating from their more generally understood interpretations.

Some terms may have multiple definitions (denoted by bullet points) and the
correct alternative should be easily inferred from the context they are used in.

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

        Altitude of :term:`vehicle` in any vertical datum or reference level.

            Describe AGL, AMSL, ellipsoid and other flavors of altitude used by GISNav.

    Extension
    Extended functionality
        Functionality beyond GISNav :term:`core` functionality. For example,
        :class:`.MockGPSNode` for integrating GISNav as a :term:`GPS` substitute
        or complement, or :class:`.RVizNode` for integrating GISNav with :term:`RViz`.

        :term:`navigation filter`.

        :term:`vehicle` relative to :term:`home`.

        .. note::
            The term "local position" often includes :term:`vehicle` attitude,
            while the term "relative position" only includes its position.
            But this distinction is currently not well established throughout
            the documentation.

            "reference", "DEM", and "stack".

    Message
        A :term:`ROS` message.

    Middleware

        the direction of the force of gravity.

    Navigation filter
        An algorithm implemented by the :term:`FMU` that is responsible for
        determining :term:`global position` and :term:`local position` based
        on available sensor inputs.

        .. note::
            :term:`EKF` is one commonly used algorithm and is often used

             <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthophoto>`_

        .. todo::
            The jargon here is still a bit loose: sometimes the aligned and
            stacked :term:`DEM` :term:`raster` is included in the term
            "orthoimage", and the term "orthophoto" is used for the
            high-resolution image only.

        In a pose estimation context, the :term:`image` frame from the
        :term:`camera`, to be compared to the :term:`reference`

            <https://carto.com/blog/raster-vs-vector-whats-the-difference-which-is-best>`_

    Reference
    Reference image
    Reference raster
        In a pose estimation context, the :term:`orthoimage` frame from the
        :term:`GIS` server, to be compared to the :term:`query image`.

        .. todo::
