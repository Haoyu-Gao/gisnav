All kinds of contributions are welcome, from raising issues with the software to software commits and pull requests
(PRs). Please see below for guidance and suggestions on how and where to contribute.

Development Objectives
==================================================
If you are interested in contributing to GISNav, you may consider the following points.

.. _Project Intention:

Project Intention
--------------------------------------------------
GISNav demonstrates a map-based visual global positioning for airborne drones that complements and improves on
existing sensor fusion systems. It improves both local and global position and attitude estimate accuracy, and provides
backup global positioning for `GNSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation>`_-denied flight.

.. _Guiding Principles:

Guiding Principles
--------------------------------------------------
The following principles have been used as design guidance when developing GISNav:

* Complement and improve but do not replace

    The natural or primary application of map-based visual global positioning is complementing GNSS, while local
    position and attitude estimation and replacing GNSS completely (GNSS-denied flight) are secondary applications.

* Maintainability and well-defined interfaces over premature optimization

    Proven and established solutions do not yet exist, and the state-of-the-art for deep learning based image matching
    especially is fast-moving.

* Support proven commercial off-the-shelf hardware platforms and `FOSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`_ software

    Best bet is to work on open platforms with the widest adoption, to ensure development can continue far into the future from a stable foundation.

* The target user is a commercial drone operator who requires accurate and reliable navigation within an urban or semi-urban environment

    In literature, such use cases may for example be called *Autonomous Landing at Unprepared Sites*


.. _Constraints:

Constraints
--------------------------------------------------
The `Guiding Principles`_ impose constraints on GISNav, namely:

* Favorable operating terrain for map-based visual matching is strongly featured urban and semi-urban areas and traffic corridors (roads or similar infrastructure), not featureless natural terrain
* Monocular stabilized camera should be sufficient
* Drone or UAV size, flight altitude or velocity constrained only to such degree that allows commercial GNSS receivers to work
* Emphasis on good flight conditions is a reasonable assumption for most commercial use cases
* Open-source software and with permissive licenses only

Development Focus
--------------------------------------------------
Taking the `Constraints`_ into account, development focus could for example be in:

* ROS is baked in, but PX4 could be complemented by other flight control software options such as Ardupilot through Mavlink compatible interface
* Newer pose estimation algorithms to improve accuracy, reliability or performance
* Using elevation or other data from the underlying GIS system to complement ortho-images to improve position and attitude estimates especially when ground plane is not "flat"
* Making adoption easier with pre-made configurations for popular hardware platforms
* SITL testing workbench development - have a way to fly premade flight plans in SITL simulation and automatically parse the flight logs and compare against some pre-set thresholds to determine if the software passes the test.
* Making it possible to re-initialize the dynamically loaded classes (:class:`.PoseEstimator`, :class:`.Filter`, :class:`.WMSClient`) at runtime to make it easy to swap in specialized neural nets or pose estimators for different terrain
* Moving to a more distributed 'ROS native' system in the long term where current modules that are managed by the :class:`.BaseNode` are spun as independent ROS nodes if possible.


Raising Issues
==================================================


Improvement Suggestions
==================================================

Commits & Pull Requests
==================================================
Merge requests (Pull requests) are welcome! Take a look at the known issues or create one yourself for your MR before
you start working so that others will also be aware of your pending work. You can also use it as an opportunity to
get feedback on your idea before you commit to it.

Once you think your merge request passes all the checks in the CI pipeline, ping me and I
will try to review your MR as soon as possible.

You can e-mail me or find me at TODO.

Please follow a typical feature-branch workflow:

* If your PR fixes or implements an issue, please link the issue in your pull requests
* In your commit messages, please describe not only *what* you have done, but *why* you have done it. This helps the maintainer understand your thought process faster.
