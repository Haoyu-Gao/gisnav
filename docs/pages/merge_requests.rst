Merge Requests
===================================================
Merge requests (Pull requests) are welcome! Take a look at the known issues or create one yourself for your MR before
you start working so that others will also be aware of your pending work. You can also use it as an opportunity to
get feedback on your idea before you commit to it.

Once you think your merge request passes all the checks in the CI pipeline, ping me and I
will try to review your MR as soon as possible.

You can e-mail me or find me at TODO.
