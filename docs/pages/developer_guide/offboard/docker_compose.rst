Deploy with Docker Compose
____________________________________________________

GISNav uses :term:`Docker Compose` to define the services that constitute its
different deployment configurations. The services are
:ref:`orchestrated by a Makefile <Deploy using Makefile>` for convenience and
for increased ease of adoption.

This page describes how these services are built and deployed individually to
help you customize GISNav's deployments beyond what the Makefile offers.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: ../_shared/prerequisites/docker.rst

.. include:: ../_shared/prerequisites/gisnav.rst

.. include:: ../_shared/prerequisites/compose_project_name_env_variable.rst


.. include:: ../../../../docker/DOCKER.rst


Overview of services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |Docker Compose file|_ defines all services used to support GISNav deployments.
The diagram below describes the system architecture through the external
interfaces and Docker bridge networks shared between the Docker Compose services.

The Docker bridge networks have in-built DNS which means the container names
resolve to their respective IP addresses. The container name will equal the
service name prefixed with ``gisnav-`` and suffixed with ``-1``. So for example
deploying the ``mapserver`` service using the Compose file will start a
Docker container with the hostname ``gisnav-mapserver-1``.

.. todo::
    * Split mavlink network into mavlink and ROS networks. For ROS the intention
      is to use the shared memory device instead of serializing and going through
      the network stack since we will be passing a lot of images around.
    * Build and expose static docs to home page - possibly no need for a server

.. note::
    The application services have access to both ``gis`` and ``mavlink`` networks.

Example deployments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interdependencies between different services are hard-coded into the
|Docker Compose file|_ and typically you will need to explicitly start
only a few services unless you also want to start optional services.

Mock GPS demo
********************************************

To deploy the mock :term:`GPS` demonstration introduced on the :ref:`Get Started`
page locally, ensure your development system satisfies all the :ref:`prerequisites
<Prerequisites>` and then follow the below steps to create, start, and shutdown
the required containers.


.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Build images and create containers

    cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav/docker
    docker compose -p gisnav create --build gisnav

.. include:: ../_shared/expose_xhost.rst

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Start containers

    cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav/docker
    docker compose -p gisnav start gisnav

.. include:: ../_shared/docker_compose_shutdown.rst

Local development
********************************************

When deploying for local development, the difference to
:ref:`deploying the Get Started demonstration <Deploy demonstration>` is that
we do not include the ``gisnav`` service which is assumed to be
:ref:`launched separately from a local development version <Launch GISNav>`:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Build images and create containers

    cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav/docker
    docker compose create --build \
        px4 \
        rviz \
        qgis

.. include:: ../_shared/expose_xhost.rst

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Start containers

    cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav/docker
    docker compose start \
        px4 \
        rviz \
        qgis

After you have your supporting services deployed you would typically
:ref:`use the ROS 2 launch system <Use ROS 2 launch system>` to launch your
locally installed development version of GISNav:

.. include:: ../_shared/launch_gisnav_with_ros2_launch.rst

.. include:: ../_shared/docker_compose_shutdown.rst
