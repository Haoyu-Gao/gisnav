____________________________________________________
`Dockerized environments <https://github.com/hmakelin/gisnav-docker>`_ are available. Take a look at the
Dockerfiles to see how everything is set up. These instructions should closely mirror what is included in the
Dockerfiles with only minor differences.

You can also take a look at the prebuilt `sitl <https://hub.docker.com/r/hmakelin/gisnav-sitl>`_ and `mapserver
<https://hub.docker.com/r/hmakelin/gisnav-mapserver>`_ images available in Docker Hub in case you have problems with
the build process.
