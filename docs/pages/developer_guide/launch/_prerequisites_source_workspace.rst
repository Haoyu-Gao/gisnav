* You will need to have sourced your ROS and colcon workspaces, eg. via your
  ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Source ROS (Foxy in this example) and colcon workspace in ~/.bashrc

    echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
