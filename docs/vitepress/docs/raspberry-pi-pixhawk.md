# Raspberry Pi 5 & Pixhawk FMUv4

This page describes how to run HIL simulation on a Pixhawk board using the Raspberry Pi 5 as a companion computer.

::: warning Warning: Propellers off
If your autopilot is connected to a vehicle, it is highly recommended to disable the propellers or take other necessary precautions to ensure the vehicle remains grounded.

:::

## Concepts

This page uses the below terminology:

- **Simulation host**: Computer that hosts the HIL simulation world (Gazebo in this case)
- **Development host**: Computer that optionally builds (potentially cross-platform) Docker images and hosts a private Docker registry for the Raspberry Pi 5 companion computer to pull (potentially non-distributable) Docker images from.

## Prerequisites

### Simulation host

<!--@include: ./shared/clone-to-colcon-workspace.md-->

::: info todo
Instructions to clone only the docker part (e.g. as a submodule).

:::

### Raspberry Pi 5

#### Docker Compose plugin

<!--@include: ./shared/docker-compose-required.md-->

::: tip Install Docker Engine on Debian
Take a look at Docker's [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) for installing Docker Engine on a Debian-based system.

:::

#### systemd

The Raspberry Pi 5 must be running a Linux distro that uses `systemd` such as Debian or one of its derivatives like Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu.

### Connectivity & networking

- You need `ssh` enabled on your Raspberry Pi 5.

- These instructions assume you are using the default hostname `raspberrypi.local` from the `rpi-imager` tool.

- Your development host and Raspberry Pi 5 must be on the same local network. You can e.g. connect them with an Ethernet cable. You may want to share Internet connection to the Raspberry Pi 5 if you want to download the Debian package directly from the Internet onto the Pi.

## Install GISNav Compose Services

::: info Building your own `.deb`
Instead of installing the `gisnav-compose` Debian package from the public registry, you can also build your own `.deb` file by following [these instructions](/create-debian).

Once you have the `.deb` file built locally or built remotely and moved to the Raspberry Pi 5 (e.g. using `ssh`), you can install `gisnav-compose` using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install ./gisnav-compose-*_all.deb

```
:::

Open an `ssh` shell to your Raspberry Pi 5:

```bash
ssh raspberrypi.local
```

<!--@include: ./shared/install-debian.md-->


## Manage GISNav Compose Services

### Start

The `gisnav-compose.service` should start automatically when the system is started. Restart the system or start the `gisnav-compose` service manually to make it active:

```bash
sudo systemctl start gisnav-compose.service
```

The below example shows how you can check that the `gisnav-compose` service is active:

```console
hmakelin@hmakelin-MS-7D48:~$ sudo systemctl status gisnav-compose.service
‚óè gisnav-compose.service - GISNav Docker Compose Services
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/gisnav-compose.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2024-05-15 15:10:21 BST; 3min 35s ago
   Main PID: 241948 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 354ms

May 15 15:10:21 hmakelin-MS-7D48 systemd[1]: Finished GISNav Docker Compose Services.

```

You can also see the service status from the onboard [Admin portal](/admin-portal).

### Stop

You can use the below commands to stop the service (and the related Docker Compose services):
```bash
sudo systemctl stop gisnav-compose.service
```

### Uninstall

If you want to uninstall the service, use the below command:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove gisnav-compose
```

### GSINav CLI

You can also try using the `gnc` command line client that comes with the Debian package to start and stop the services:

```bash
gnc start gisnav
```

```bash
gnc stop
```

## Connect Raspberry Pi 5 and Pixhawk

- We connect our development computer to the Raspberry Pi 5 over Ethernet. This is so that we can upload the containers implementing required onboard services.

- We connect the Raspberry Pi 5 as a secondary NMEA GPS device over the GPS 2 serial port.

- We connect the simulation host computer (assumed to be the same as the development computer but strictly speaking these could be separate computers.)

## Upload PX4 firmware

See the [PX4 uploading firmware instructions](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/building_px4.html#uploading-firmware-flashing-the-board) for how to upload your development version of PX4 onto your Pixhawk board (should look something like `make px4_fmu-v4_default upload`) for FMUv4.

To find the `make` target for your specific board, list all options with the `make list_config_targets` command on your development host computer:

```bash
# on development host (not on Raspberry Pi)
cd ~/colcon_ws/src/gisnav/docker
docker compose -p gisnav run px4 make list_config_targets
```

Then choose your appropriate board for the following examples. We are going to choose `nxp_fmuk66-e_default` for this example:

```bash
# on development host (not on Raspberry Pi)
docker compose -p gisnav run px4 make distclean
docker compose -p gisnav run px4 make nxp_fmuk66-e_default upload
```

## Deploy HIL simulation

### Offboard services

The following steps to deploy the offboard services are based on the [PX4 HIL simulation instructions](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/simulation/hitl.html). The `px4` Docker compose service has a custom `iris_hitl` model and a `hitl_iris_ksql_airport.world` Gazebo world that we are going to use in this example:

::: info TODO
Update the commands below to start the HIL simulation offboard services (need to update override file)

:::

```bash
# on development host (not on Raspberry Pi)
docker compose -p gisnav run -e DONT_RUN=1 px4 make px4_sitl_default gazebo-classic
docker compose -p gisnav run px4 source Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
docker compose -p gisnav run px4 gazebo Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic/worlds/hitl_iris_ksql_airport.world

# Important: Start QGroundControl last
docker compose up qgc
```

After deploying the HIL simulation, adjust the settings via the QGC application as follows:

- Precisely match the `COM_RC_IN_MODE` parameter setting if mentioned in the instructions.
- Ensure that you have HITL enabled in QGC Safety settings.
- You may also need to enable the virtual joystick enabled in QGC General settings to prevent failsafes from triggering.

### Onboard services

Ensure that you have started the `gisnav-compose` systemd service:

```bash
# on Raspberry Pi 5
sudo systemctl start gisnav-compose
```

You can also use Docker to check that the GISNav containers are running:

```bash
# on Raspberry Pi 5
# may require sudo depending on how you have setup docker on your Pi
docker ps
```

::: tip Admin portal
You can also use the [Admin portal](/admin-portal) hosted on the Raspberry Pi 5 to see that the core services are running.
