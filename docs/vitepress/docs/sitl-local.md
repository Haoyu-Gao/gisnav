# Simulate GPS failure

This page describes how to prepare and deploy a local SITL simulation environment. The below video shows what the local SITL simulation should look like.

::: details Note on Docker commands seen on video
Unlike in the video, the simulation environment is no longer provided in a single container and is managed by `gnc` instead. The `gisnav-docker` repository seen in the beginning of the video is no longer maintained, and all the Docker source files have been moved over to the main `gisnav` repository.

## Example walkthrough

The below steps demonstrate how GISNav enables GNSS-free flight with PX4 Autopilot's [Mission mode][1] in a SITL simulation.

[1]: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_modes/mission.html

### Prerequisites

- Install the GISNav CLI via the [Debian package](/install-from-debian-package).

### Build and start SITL simulation

Prepare the containers for the SITL simulation environment:

```bash
gnc create --build px4 gisnav
```

Start your simulation:

<!--@include: ./shared/slow-gazebo-startup-on-first-run.md-->

```bash
gnc start px4 gisnav
```


### Upload flight plan via QGroundControl

Once both the Gazebo and QGroundControl windows have appeared (QGroundControl should show the vehicle location near San Carlos airport), use QGroundControl to upload the sample `~/ksql_airport_px4.plan` flight plan that is included inside the Docker container, and then start the mission.

### Simulate GPS failure

After a while and once the vehicle has gained some altitude you should see a visualization of the GISNav-estimated field of view projected on the ground appear. You can then try disabling GPS through your [MAVLink or NSH shell][4] (accessible e.g. through QGroundControl > Analyze Tools > MAVLink Console):

```nsh
failure gps off
```

The vehicle should now continue to complete its mission GNSS-free with GISNav substituting for GPS.

You can check if PX4 is receiving the mock GPS position estimates by typing the following in the MAVLink shell:

```nsh
listener sensor_gps
```
