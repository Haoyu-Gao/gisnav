# Glossary

::: warning Warning: Frequent revision
These definitions are frequently revised as the software is developed and therefore may not always correspond to what is currently written in the source code.

## Terminology

Here we provide explanations for terms used throughout this documentation that are more esoteric or represent jargon i.e. have meanings unique to the context of this documentation, deviating from their more generally understood interpretations.

Some terms may have multiple definitions (e.g. [parameter](#parameter) or [frame](#frame)) and the correct alternative should be easily inferred from the context. Similarly, multiple terms may be used to refer to the same concept depending on the context (e.g. [robot](#robot) vs. [vehicle](#vehicle)).

:::

### Raster

### Vehicle
The [UAV](#uav) that uses GISNav for visual navigation. Can e.g., be a quadcopter or fixed-wing aircraft. This term is preferred by autopilot software like [PX4](#px4) and [ArduPilot](#ardupilot), while the more generic term [robot](#robot) is often used in the [ROS](#ros-ros-2) context.
