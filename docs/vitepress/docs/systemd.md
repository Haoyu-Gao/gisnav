# GISNav systemd service

This page describes how to use the `gisnav.service` systemd service that is included with the [Debian package](/install-from-debian-package).

The service is intended to be installed on a dedicated companion computer where GISNav is required to start automatically when the board is powered on. The service does not build images, it only creates a new container from an existing image if no container is available.

## Install

Install the service by [installing the Debian package](/install-from-debian-package).

## Enable on startup <Badge type="info" text="Optional"/>

The service is disabled by default. Enable it with the following command:

::: warning Warning: Resource constrained systems
Assuming you are installing this on a resource constrained companion computer, enabling the `gisnav.service` on startup will slow down your system.

:::

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gisnav.service
```

## Disable

The following command disables the service on startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable gisnav.service
```

## Start

Once enabled, the `gisnav.service` should start automatically when the system is started. Restart the system or start the `gisnav` service manually with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start gisnav.service
```

## Stop

```bash
sudo systemctl stop gisnav.service
```

## Check status

The below example shows how you can check that the `gisnav` service is active:

```console
hmakelin@hmakelin-MS-7D48:~$ sudo systemctl status gisnav.service
