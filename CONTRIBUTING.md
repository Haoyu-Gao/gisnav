## Pull requests and software commits

> **Warning**
> By contributing to this repository, you agree that **your contributions will be licensed under the repository's MIT

All changes to the software are made through [pull requests][2]. Please pay attention to the following before you 
submit your pull request:

* See [Style Guide for Python Code][4] for general code style guidelines.

* If your pull request is related to an existing [open issue][1], please mention it in your pull request description.

* If your pull request addresses a new issue or improvement, consider posting it on the [open issues][1] page before 
  you start working on it so that others will also be aware of your pending work.

* Consider creating a [draft pull request][5] to get early feedback on your work before you commit to it further.

* In your pull request, please describe not only *what* you have done, but also *why* you have done it. This helps the 
  reviewer understand your thought process faster.

* If your pull request makes use of 3rd party software, please ensure that it is MIT license compatible.
