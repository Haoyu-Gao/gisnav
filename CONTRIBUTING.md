All changes to the software are made through [pull requests][2]. Please pay attention to the following before you 
submit your pull request:

* If your pull request is related to an existing [open issue][1], please mention it in your pull request description.

* If your pull request addresses a new issue or improvement, consider posting it on the [open issues][1] page before 
  you start working on it so that others will also be aware of your pending work.

* If your pull request makes use of 3rd party software, please ensure that it is MIT license compatible.

* Consider creating a [draft pull request][3] to get early feedback on your work before you commit to it further.

* In your pull request, please describe not only *what* you have done, but also *why* you have done it. This helps the 
  reviewer understand your thought process faster.

## Improvements and new features

If you are planning to add a new feature or improve an existing feature of the software, please ensure that your 
contribution is aligned with GISNav's **development focus**. Currently the **development focus** is to make the software:

* **Easier to use**, for example by...
  * ...improving documentation
  * ...streamlining the public API
  * ...smoothing out configuration quirks
* **Better tested**, for example by...
  * ...improving unit test coverage
  * ...adding a (better) testing framework
* **Support relevant technology stacks**, for example by...
  * ...adding support for Ardupilot
  * ...adding an adapter for TensorFlow-based neural networks
* **More accurate**, for example by...
  * ...adding a new state-of-the art pose estimation algorithm
  * ...making use of digital-elevation maps (DEM) to retrieve elevation of ground plane
  * ...making use of the [OSM buildings][4] database to remove assumption of planar ground surface

> **Note**
> Please consider the examples in the second level bullet points as *suggestions* on where to find low-hanging fruit rather than 
> as *recommendations* on what to do.
