# This Makefile is used as a Docker container orchestration tool to deploy
# various Docker Compose services that support GISNav.
#
# The terminology used in this Makefile includes the following:
#   - FMU: Flight Management Unit, the onboard flight controller computer
#		board (e.g., Pixhawk) that runs the autopilot software.
#   - HIL: Hardware-In-The-Loop, a simulation mode where the autopilot runs
#		onboard the FMU.
#   - SITL: Software-In-The-Loop, a simulation mode where the autopilot is
#		executed offboard on a separate computer, replicating the drone's
#		flight dynamics and sensors, enabling testing and development without
#		using actual hardware.
#   - Offboard: Refers to services that run on a computer not carried by the
#		drone and not powered by the drone battery (e.g., a powerful desktop).
#   - Onboard: Refers to services that run on the drone itself, powered by the
#		drone's battery, like the FMU and onboard companion computer (e.g.,
#  		Nvidia Jetson Nano). In the case of GISNav, all onboard services are
#		intended to run on the companion computer and not e.g. on the FMU.
#   - Middleware: Software that sits between the autopilot and GISNav, enabling
#		communication between them.
#   - QGC: QGroundControl, a ground control station software used to monitor
#		and control drones.
#   - Gazebo: A robotics simulator used to simulate the drone's environment and
#		its interactions with the world.
#
# The target options in the Makefile are as follows:
#   - onboard-hil-*: Targets for onboard hardware-in-the-loop services,
#		including GIS server, ROS middleware, autoheal, and GISNav.
#   - onboard-sitl-*: Targets for onboard software-in-the-loop services, with
#		the same services as onboard HIL but using a different middleware
#		configuration.
#   - offboard-sitl-*: Targets for offboard software-in-the-loop services,
#		including Gazebo simulation and QGroundControl.
#   - offboard-sitl-test-*: Targets for SITL testing services, which exclude
#		GISNav and QGC for automated testing scenarios. Gazebo in headless mode.
#   - offboard-sitl-dev-*: Targets for SITL development services, including
#		Gazebo simulation, ROS middleware, mapserver, torch-serve, and QGC, but
#		excluding GISNav whose development version is assumed to be run locally.
#   - demo-*: Shortcut targets for demo purposes, setting up all SITL services
#		offboard, including GIS server, ROS middleware, Gazebo simulation, QGC,
#		and GISNav.
