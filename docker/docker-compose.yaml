# This Docker Compose file is the main configuration for the GISNav project.
# It defines the volumes, networks, and services required to run the GISNav system.
# Each service is either pulled from an upstream registry or built from a specified #
# context. Environment variables configured as necessary.

  # Socat is used to bridge the output serial port to the PX4 SITL container
  # over TCP - mapping serial ports to Docker host serial ports would be
  # a bit more messy. For production deployments the socat command is expected
  # to be left out.
